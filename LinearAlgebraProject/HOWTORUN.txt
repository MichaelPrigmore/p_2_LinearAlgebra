App Description

The Linear Algebra App allows users to input values to create a matrix. Elementary row operations from 
linear algebra are used to put the entered matrix into an Echelon Form. Echelon Forms are not unique. 
The app then continues to operate on the matrix until it is in its unique Reduced Echelon Form. Each 
matrix has only one Reduced Echelon Form. All three matrices are printed for the user to see.

How to Use the App

Run the main program found in the Linear_Algebra_App.java file. It's path in the project folder is:
Linear_Algebra_App/src/Presentation_Logic/Linear_Algebra_App.java

Type in the number of rows your matrix needs and press enter. This value must be an integer greater 
than 1. 

Type in the number of columns your matrix needs and press enter. This value must be an integer greater 
than 1.

Enter the number for each value in your matrix. Press enter after each number. You will be prompted to
enter the values at positions (m,n) where m is the index of the row and n is the index of the column of
the position in question. For example, position (0,0) is the top left position in the matrix representing
the position in the first row, first column. Position (2,3) refers to the position in the third row and
the fourth column. Values are entered moving from left-to-right, top-to-bottom starting at position (0,0).
For example, values for a matrix with two rows and two columns would be entered in the following order:
(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1,)

After these values are entered, the original matrix, echelon form, and reduced echelon form will be printed.
The program terminates after the matrices are printed.

Below, a sample is given of the program output with the entered values. You can enter the same values to 
get the same matricies:
